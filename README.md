Key Components:

  Data Collection:
    Use publicly available cloud infrastructure datasets (like the Azure Open Datasets or UCI Machine Learning Repository) related to server performance metrics (CPU usage, memory, disk read/write speeds, temperature).
    Simulate server failure data if actual failure data isn't available.
    
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Perform EDA to understand the distribution of key features and detect patterns or correlations between metrics and system failures.
  
  Feature Engineering: 
    Create meaningful features from raw data, such as:
      Rolling averages of CPU/memory usage
      Time since last maintenance
      Temperature spikes
  
  Model Development:
    Train multiple machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost to predict the likelihood of server failure.
    Compare models using performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC).
  
  Model Optimization & Hyperparameter Tuning:
  Fine-tune the best-performing models using techniques like Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization.
  
  Deployment:
  Deploy the final model in a simulated environment where it can continuously monitor server data and send alerts when failure probability exceeds a certain threshold.
